## <a name="about_me">About me</a>

I'm a determined, passionate, and curious **Full Stack Software Developer**, looking to join a company on an exciting journey where I can use my skills and knowledge to help create innovative and meaningful solutions. I would like to make a real impact while making a positive contribution to the team and the company.
In my search for my passion, I came across coding and quickly realized its potential, the challenge, and the potential to change lives.

In August 2022, I began studying software development at Makers Academy where I realized my natural aptitude for coding. In order to gain a deeper understanding of various programming languages and frameworks and apply my knowledge to real-world projects, I used my analytical mind and curiosity.

## <a name="skills">Skills</a>

#### Fast Learner, time management skills ####
- As part of Makers, I learned Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB while building a social media site in a few weeks, without being taught during the course and no prior experience. 
- As I transitioned from Senior Interviewer to Supervisor, I had to develop many soft skills quickly in order to lead a team effectively.
- The London bus network is one of the main forms of transport in the city, and as it needs to follow a strict timetable to ensure London keeps moving, I had to adhere to the timetable despite challenging situations.

#### Analytical thinker, high level of concentration ####
- As well as having a desire to understand relevant coding concepts in detail, I enjoy writing creative, clean code.
- When I am coding, I demonstrate a high level of concentration, this is my comfort zone. During a project, I actively seek challenging tickets to demonstrate my analytical abilities. 
- When issues are brought up during stand ups that prevent a team member from completing a ticket, I am quick to offer assistance to identify and resolve the issue.

#### Leadership, communication ####
- My supervisor role in Network Research required me to keep track of statistical data to ensure telephone interviewers met survey targets hourly. We would have to devise a plan if a target wasn't met, and I would have to ensure my team was motivated throughout the process. If it was a long-term productivity issue, I would have to conduct a performance review. 
- Through the course of my work in Makers, I took on the role of team leader to make sure tickets were completed and we met the deadline for presenting our projects.
- I was thrown into the deep at the beginning of my supervisor role in the London call centre, which manages all call centres. I was left alone when an IT failure occurred, and I was responsible for repairing it or productivity would suffer. I had to take charge, communicate with many different departments while leading the repair.
